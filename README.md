# React module start kit

## Requirements
* node `^4.2.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

After confirming that your development environment meets the specified [requirements](#requirements), you can follow these steps to get the project up and running:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:SumatoSoft/react-module-start-kit.git MODULE_NAME
$ cd MODULE_NAME
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

## Development

## Testing
To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them. If you are using `redux-cli`, test files should automatically be generated when you create a component or redux module.

Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/index.js`.

## Build System
```
NODE_ENV=production npm run compile
```
or use [Gem](https://github.com/SumatoSoft/psychometrics-survey) rake task `build` or `release`

### Styles

Both `.scss` and `.css` file extensions are supported out of the box and are configured to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). After being imported, styles will be processed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for minification and autoprefixing, and will be extracted to a `.css` file during production builds.

### Server

This starter kit comes packaged with an Koa server. It's important to note that the sole purpose of this server is to provide `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware` for hot module replacement. Using a custom Koa app in place of [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) makes it easier to extend the starter kit to include functionality such as API's, universal rendering, and more -- all without bloating the base boilerplate.
